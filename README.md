# Zulu
## What is Zulu?
Zulu is a CTF server currently in development by the Cardiff Met CTF society
for use with our challenges produced by members of our society. It will allow
us to keep track of the number of flags and points associated with them for
each member of our society, which will be displayed on a society-wide
leaderboard. Zulu will be designed to be university agnostic and highly
configurable, allowing other university societies to use our software for their
own uses if they so wish, with their own branding and such. Zulu is licensed
under the GPLv3 and is free software.

## Running Zulu
Simply `git clone` this repo and run `cargo run` in your terminal :)
